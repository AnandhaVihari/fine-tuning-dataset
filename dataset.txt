Each stage is managed by smart contracts for transparency and security."}
{"prompt": "How does the Provider Lookup phase work in Spheron?", "completion": "When a user initiates a server deployment request, it enters the PROVIDER_LOOKUP state, triggering eligible network providers to start the bidding process. Providers compete to fulfill the request based on the deployment criteria."}
{"prompt": "What happens during Spheron's bidding process?", "completion": "During PROVIDER_LOOKUP, eligible providers submit CREATE_BID transactions for the requested resources. Bidding is limited to 1-2 blocks, after which the matchmaking engine selects the optimal provider and forwards the result to the Order Smart Contract."}
{"prompt": "How does lease creation work in Spheron's deployment process?", "completion": "After provider selection, the Order Smart Contract updates the status to CREATE_LEASE, triggering an event for the provider to reserve resources.
